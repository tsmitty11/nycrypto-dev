Acknowledgment of Certain Risks; Other Disclaimers; Release of Claims
By accessing and using the Services, you represent that you understand the inherent risks associated with using cryptographic and blockchain-based systems and that you have a working knowledge of the usage and intricacies of Digital Assets. You further understand that the markets for these Digital Assets are highly volatile due to factors including (but not limited to) adoption, speculation, technology, security, and regulation. You acknowledge and accept that the cost and speed of transacting with cryptographic and blockchain-based systems such as Solana are variable and may increase dramatically at any time. You further acknowledge and accept the risk that your Digital Assets, or any Digital Assets you acquire, including through a third-party exchange accessed via the wallet may lose some or all of their value and you may suffer a loss due to the fluctuation of prices of tokens and/or significant price slippage and cost. You understand that anyone can create a token, including fake versions of existing tokens and tokens that falsely claim to represent projects, and acknowledge and accept the risk that you may mistakenly trade those or other tokens. You further acknowledge that we are not responsible for any of these variables or risks and that we cannot be held liable for any resulting losses that you experience while accessing or using the Site or Services.

The Services and your Digital Assets could be impacted by one or more regulatory inquiries or regulatory actions, which could impede or limit the ability of Nycrypto to continue to make its proprietary software, and thus, could impede or limit your ability to continue to use the Services.

You understand and acknowledge that cryptography is a progressing field with advances in code-cracking and other technical advancements, such as the development of quantum computers, which may present risks to Digital Assets and services, and could result in the theft or loss of your Digital Assets. To the extent possible, we intend to update Nycrypto-developed smart contracts and other products related to the Services to account for any advances in cryptography and to incorporate additional security measures necessary to address risks presented from technological advancements, but that intention does not reflect a binding commitment and does not in any way guarantee or otherwise ensure full security of the Services.

You understand that the ETHEREUM, POLYGON, BITCOIN, FANTOM, AVAX, AND SOLANA NETWORKS Solana blockchain (and all other networks with which the Services may be compatible) remains under development, which creates technological and security risks when using the Services in addition to uncertainty relating to Digital Assets and transactions therein. You acknowledge that the cost of transacting on the ETHEREUM, POLYGON, BITCOIN, FANTOM, AVAX, AND Solana blockchains are variable and may increase at any time, thereby impacting any activities taking place on those blockchains, which may result in price fluctuations or increased prices for using the Services.

You acknowledge that the Services are subject to flaws and that you are solely responsible for evaluating any code provided by the Site or Services. This warning and others Nycrypto provides in these Terms in no way evidence or represent any ongoing duty to alert you of the potential risks of utilizing the Services or accessing the Site.

Although we intend to provide accurate and timely information on the Site and during your use of the Services, that intention does not reflect a binding commitment, and the Site and other information available when using the Services may not be accurate, complete, error-free, or current. To continue to provide you with as complete and accurate information as possible, information may be changed or updated from time to time without notice, including, without limitation, information regarding our policies. Accordingly, you should verify all information before relying on it in any manner, and all decisions based on such information contained on the Site or made available through the Services are your sole and absolute responsibility. No representation of any kind or nature is made as to the accuracy, completeness or appropriateness for any particular purpose of any pricing or other information distributed via the Site or Services. Pricing information may be higher or lower than prices available on platforms providing similar services.

Any reference to a type of Digital Asset on the Site or otherwise during the use of the Services does not indicate our approval or disapproval of the technology on which the Digital Asset relies, and should not be used as a substitute for your understanding of the risks specific to each type of Digital Asset.

Use of the Services, in particular for trading Digital Assets, may carry financial risk. Digital Assets are, by their nature, highly experimental, risky, and volatile. Transactions entered into in connection with the Services are irreversible, final and there are no refunds. You acknowledge and agree that you will access and use the Site and the Services at your own risk. The risk of loss in trading Digital Assets can be substantial. You should, therefore, carefully consider whether such trading is suitable for you in light of your circumstances and financial resources. By using the Services, you represent and warrant that you have been, are, and will be solely responsible for making your independent appraisal and investigations into the risks of a given transaction and the underlying Digital Assets.

All transactions between users of Nycrypto-developed software are executed peer-to-peer directly between the users' Solana (or other network) addresses through smart contracts. You are responsible for complying with all laws that may be applicable to or govern your use of the Services, including, but not limited to, the Commodity Exchange Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission ("CFTC"), the federal securities laws and the regulations promulgated thereunder by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and all foreign applicable laws.

Dispute Resolution
Governing Law

These Terms shall be construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the state of California applicable to contracts entered into and performed in California by residents thereof; provided that all provisions hereof related to arbitration shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act (U.S. Code Title 9).

Mandatory Arbitration

PLEASE READ THIS "MANDATORY ARBITRATION" PROVISION VERY CAREFULLY. IT LIMITS YOUR RIGHTS IN THE EVENT OF A DISPUTE BETWEEN YOU AND NYCRYPTO, SUBJECT TO THE TERMS AND OPT-OUT OPTION SET FORTH BELOW.

You and Nycrypto agree that any and all past, present and future disputes, claims, or causes of action arising out of or relating to your use of any of the Site or the Services, this Agreement, or any other controversies or disputes between you and Nycrypto (including, without limitation, disputes regarding the effectiveness, scope, validity or enforceability of this agreement to arbitrate) (collectively, "Dispute(s)"), shall be determined by arbitration, unless (A) your Country of Residence does not allow this arbitration agreement; (B) you opt-out as provided below; or (C) your Dispute is subject to an exception to this agreement to arbitrate set forth below. You and Nycrypto further agree that any arbitration pursuant to this Section shall not proceed as a class, group or representative action. The award of the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.

"Country of Residence" for purposes of this agreement to arbitrate means the country in which you hold citizenship or legal permanent residence, as well as any country from which you regularly access and use the Nycrypto Services. If more than one country meets that definition for you, then your country of citizenship or legal permanent residence shall be your Country of Residence, and if you have more than one country of citizenship or legal permanent residence, it shall be the country with which you most closely are associated by permanent or most frequent residence.

Nycrypto wants to address your concerns without the need for a formal legal dispute. Before filing a claim against Nycrypto, you agree to try to resolve the Dispute informally by contacting Nycrypto at developers@Nycrypto.co to notify Nycrypto of the actual or potential Dispute. Similarly, Nycrypto will undertake reasonable efforts to contact you to notify you of any actual or potential dispute to resolve any claim we may possess informally before taking any formal action. The party that provides the notice of the actual or potential Dispute (the "Notifying Party") will include in that notice (a "Notice of Dispute") the name of User, the Notifying Party's contact information for any communications relating to such Dispute (including for the Notifying Party's legal counsel if it is represented by counsel in connection with such Dispute), and sufficient details regarding such Dispute to enable the other party (the "Notified Party") to understand the basis of and evaluate the concerns raised. If the Notified Party responds within ten (10) business days after receiving the Notice of Dispute that it is ready and willing to engage in good faith discussions in an effort to resolve the Dispute informally, then each party shall promptly participate in such discussions in good faith.

If, notwithstanding the Notifying Party's compliance with all of its obligations under the preceding paragraph, a Dispute is not resolved within 30 days after the Notice of Dispute is sent (or if the Notified Party fails to respond to the Notice of Dispute within ten (10) business days), the Notifying Party may initiate an arbitration proceeding as described below. If either party purports to initiate arbitration without first providing a Notice of Dispute and otherwise complying with all of its obligations under the preceding paragraph, then, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the arbitrator(s) will promptly dismiss the claim with prejudice and will award the other party all of its costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred in connection with such Dispute.

We both agree to arbitrate (unless you opt-out as described below). You and Nycrypto each agree to resolve any Disputes that are not resolved informally as described above through final and binding arbitration as discussed herein, except as set forth under "Exceptions to Agreement To Arbitrate" below.

If you do not wish to be subject to this agreement to arbitrate, you may opt-out of this arbitration provision by sending a written notice to Nycrypto at developers@Nycrypto.co within thirty (30) days of first accepting this Agreement. You must date the written notice, and include your first and last name, address, and a clear statement that you do not wish to resolve disputes with Nycrypto through arbitration. If no written notice is submitted by the 30-day deadline, you will be deemed to have knowingly and intentionally waived your right to litigate any Dispute except with regard to the exceptions set forth below. By opting out of the agreement to arbitrate, you will not be precluded from using the Nycrypto Service, but you and Nycrypto will not be permitted to invoke the mutual agreement to arbitrate to resolve Disputes under the terms otherwise provided herein.

You and Nycrypto agree that the American Arbitration Association ("_ AAA ") will administer the arbitration under its Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes in effect at the time arbitration is sought ("AAA Rules"). Those rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules. (The AAA provides a general Demand for Arbitration.) The arbitration will proceed on an individual basis and will be handled by a sole arbitrator. The single arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law and will be selected by the parties from the AAA's roster of arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within fourteen (14) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules. The arbitrator shall be authorized to award any remedies, including injunctive relief, that would be available to you hereunder in an individual lawsuit. Notwithstanding any language to the contrary in this paragraph, if a party seeks injunctive relief that would significantly impact other Nycrypto users as reasonably determined by either party, the parties agree that such arbitration will proceed on an individual basis but will be handled by a panel of three (3) arbitrators. Each party shall select one arbitrator, and the two party-selected arbitrators shall select the third, who shall serve as chair of the arbitral panel. That chairperson shall be a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law and with experience arbitrating or mediating disputes. In the event of disagreement as to whether the threshold for a three-arbitrator panel has been met, the sole arbitrator appointed in accordance with this Section shall make that determination. If the arbitrator determines a three-person panel is appropriate, the arbitrator may – if selected by either party or as the chair by the two party-selected arbitrators – participate in the arbitral panel. Except as and to the extent otherwise may be required by law, the arbitration proceeding and any award shall be confidential.

You and Nycrypto further agree that the arbitration will be held in the English language in San Francisco, California, or, if you so elect, all proceedings can be conducted via videoconference, telephonically or via other remote electronic means. If Nycrypto elects arbitration, Nycrypto shall pay all of the AAA filing costs and administrative fees (other than hearing fees). If you elect arbitration, filing costs and administrative fees (other than hearing fees) shall be paid in accordance with the AAA Rules, or in accordance with countervailing law if contrary to the AAA Rules. However, if the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, at your request, Nycrypto will pay all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration, unless the arbitrator(s) finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)). In such circumstances, fees will be determined in accordance with the AAA Rules. Each party shall bear the expense of its own attorneys' fees, except as otherwise provided herein or required by law.

You and Nycrypto agree that the arbitration of any Dispute shall proceed on an individual basis, and neither you nor Nycrypto may bring a claim as a part of a class, group, collective, coordinated, consolidated or mass arbitration (each, a "Collective Arbitration"). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, a claim to resolve any Dispute against Nycrypto will be deemed a Collective Arbitration if (i) two (2) or more similar claims for arbitration are filed concurrently by or on behalf of one or more claimants; and (ii) counsel for the claimants are the same, share fees or coordinate across the arbitrations. "Concurrently" for purposes of this provision means that both arbitrations are pending (filed but not yet resolved) at the same time.

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER YOU NOR NYCRYPTO SHALL BE ENTITLED TO CONSOLIDATE, JOIN OR COORDINATE DISPUTES BY OR AGAINST OTHER INDIVIDUALS OR ENTITIES, OR ARBITRATE OR LITIGATE ANY DISPUTE IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY, INCLUDING AS A REPRESENTATIVE MEMBER OF A CLASS OR IN A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL CAPACITY. IN CONNECTION WITH ANY DISPUTE (AS DEFINED ABOVE), ANY AND ALL SUCH RIGHTS ARE HEREBY EXPRESSLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVED. Without limiting the foregoing, any challenge to the validity of this paragraph shall be determined exclusively by the arbitrator.

Notwithstanding your and Nycrypto's agreement to arbitrate Disputes, either you or Nycrypto retain the following rights:

You and Nycrypto retain the right (A) to bring an individual action in small claims process in the courts of your Country of Residence; and (B) to seek provisional relief in aid of arbitration in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights. Further, this agreement to arbitrate does not deprive you of the protection of the mandatory provisions of the consumer protection laws in your Country of Residence; you shall retain any such rights and this agreement to arbitrate shall be construed accordingly.

Except as otherwise required by applicable law or provided in this Agreement, in the event that the agreement to arbitrate is found not to apply to you or your Dispute, you and Nycrypto agree that any judicial proceeding may only be brought in a court of competent jurisdiction in California, United States. Both you and Nycrypto consent to venue and personal jurisdiction there; provided that either party may seek provisional relief in aid of arbitration to enforce its intellectual property rights as provided above or bring an action to confirm an arbitral award in any court having jurisdiction.

This agreement to arbitrate shall survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement. With the exception of the provisions of this agreement to arbitrate that prohibit Collective Arbitration if a court decides that any part of this agreement to arbitrate is invalid or unenforceable, then the remaining portions of this agreement to arbitrate shall nevertheless remain valid and in force. In the event that a court finds the prohibition of Collective Arbitration to be invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this agreement to arbitrate shall be deemed void (but no provisions of this Agreement unrelated to arbitration shall be void), and any remaining Dispute must be litigated in court pursuant to the preceding paragraph.
